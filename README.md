# usbo

Hello, I'm *Davide Usberti*, also known as *333revenge* or *usbo* — an Italian software developer and cybersecurity enthusiast.

With 7+ years of experience, I specialize in **system programming in C**, working with data structures, low-level memory, and networking via **sockets**. I'm also experienced as a **full-stack backend developer**, using technologies like **Node.js**, **Next.js**, **Prisma**, and **tRPC**.

I enjoy building efficient tools, exploring how systems work under the hood, and developing reliable backend infrastructure.
